Purpose:

To demonstrate that you know how to move the camera by
strafing (moving the camera sideways).

This project should take no longer than a half hour.
If having problems, email me.

Take Demo18 as a base.  Look at how movement is defined
when pressing the up and down keys, where the movement
is defined relative to the camera space's -z units (well,
it's not the full camera space, just the translate and rotate y)

1) (25 points)Implement strafing by, when the user holds
LEFT_SHIFT and presses left, move along the camera space's
x axis by some multiple of -1.

2) (25 points) If not pressing shift,
the camera should be rotated like normal

3) (25 points) Implement strafing by, when the user holds
LEFT_SHIFT and presses right, move along the camera space's
x axis by some multiple of 1.

4) (25 points) If not pressing shift,
the camera should be rotated like normal
