- Implement a game of Pong in Python, using the NDC
  coordinate system.  Pong has two paddles, and a ball
  which moves back and forth.  If unfamiliar with the game,
  look it up on youtube.
  On collision of the ball
  with and edge or a paddle, it changes direction.
  When a score happens, a new ball should come out 3 seconds
  later.
  You do not need to keep track of the score, just the rendering,
  collision detection, and changing of the ball's velocity.
