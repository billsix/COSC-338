Purpose:

To demonstrate that you can put geometry where you want to

Take Demo16 as a base for 1 and 2, Demo19 as the base for
3 and 4.

This will involve making a loop.  If you think in degrees,
convert to radians using math.radians(amount_in_degrees).
Also, since Python is highly dependent on whitespace, when
you add a loop to a section of code that used to be without
a loop, you want to make sure that you indent the now-looped
section correctly.  See if Visual Studio has a method by
which to indent a selected region.  I do this with emacs
"C-c >" or "C-c <"

1) (15 points) Change the distance of the blue square to be 50 units
away instead of 20

2) (35 points) Make 4 blue squares instead of 1, each of which is 90 degrees
apart.



For doing it with demo19

This one will be similar to the above, but you will need to be able
to hold onto a current axis set and revert back to it using glpushmatrix/glpopmatrix
using the model stack, or use the auxillary PushMatrix class in demo19/pyMatrixStack.

3) (15 points) Change the distance of the blue square to be 50 units
away instead of 20

4) (35 points) Make 4 blue squares instead of 1, each of which is 90 degrees
apart.
