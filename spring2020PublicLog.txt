 -TODO on Monday - Show the fun demos.  glPortal.  Craft. Water demo, etc.
 -Covered up to Demo06.  Update lesson 6 regarding Global Space (as I didn't explain what that meant, I just covered NDC)
 -Redo Demo6.  Repetition is good but slow down.  Don't let speed through the repetitive parts make me go to fast on the new parts
