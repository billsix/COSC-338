Agenda 05 FEB 2020

- remention slack.  Instructions are in this repo "Slack Instructions.txt"
  I am making announcements regarding the class there.  I highly
  recommend that people join that channel.
- go over demo 14 - as far as I can go.

- cover blocking vs non-blocking io. Describe how you are using tail.



Material to be covered at unknown date that may not be covered in the book:
Subset of linear algebra
  - matrix multiplication
  - inverses
  - dot product
  - cross product
  - right hand rule
  - viewing matrix multiplication front to back vs back to front
  - tree of transformations from a top level space
  - perhaps RREF
  - perhaps A=CDR to demonstrate row space vs column space,
    as well as being useful towards projecting geometry for
    the shadow section of the OpenGL Superbible v4, old testament.
Debugging
  - gdb for C code (build Craft in debug mode using CMake)
  - pdb for python
  - how to use
     - set breakpoints
     - step line
