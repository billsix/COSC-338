Agenda 29 JAN 2020

- demo GLPortal - make sure it's built correctly
- cover the math behind the 3 rotation demos.
- re-cover the scissor test
- cover blocking vs non-blocking io. Describe how you are using tail.
- Re go over from demo 06 on, make sure to show demo06.png.  I went a little to fast last time.
- Cover up to camera space (demo10).  I doubt we will, but if we get to camera space,
  go over the currency diagrams, and talk about inversions.  If the students
  can understand this univariate example, they will have a solid foundation
  to take on everything in the ModelViewProject Tree.
  I will need to write up more in the comments for this demo though.


Material to be covered at unknown date that may not be covered in the book:
Subset of linear algebra
  - matrix multiplication
  - inverses
  - dot product
  - cross product
  - right hand rule
  - viewing matrix multiplication front to back vs back to front
  - tree of transformations from a top level space
  - perhaps RREF
  - perhaps A=CDR to demonstrate row space vs column space,
    as well as being useful towards projecting geometry for
    the shadow section of the OpenGL Superbible v4, old testament.
Debugging
  - gdb for C code (build Craft in debug mode using CMake)
  - pdb for python
  - how to use
     - set breakpoints
     - step line
     - step in
     - step out
