Agenda 27 JAN 2020
- Ask who has successfully downloaded modelviewprojection and
 got it up and running.  Look at homework.txt.  I am figuring
 out blackboard, am setting up a slack channel, in order to communicate
 homework/assignments, and to faciliate class discussion.
 I need feedback to ensure that everyone is on the same page,
 whether they miss class on a day or not.
- Ask about Python.  Did people have trouble reading the code?
- Ask about speed of demos.
- Show the fun demos. Minecraft in Python.  Craft in C. glPortal. opengldemos (Water demo is 15).
- Show the MVP demo and animated demo to show why we are learning what we are learning
- Demonstrate Method Chaining.
- cover blocking vs non-blocking io.
- Re go over from demo 05 on.  I went a little to fast last time.  Rego over
 the stencil buffer, as I did not spend enough time on it.
