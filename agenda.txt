Agenda 27 JAN 2020
- Ask who has successfully downloaded modelviewprojection and
 got it up and running.  Look at homework.txt.  I am figuring
 out blackboard, am setting up a slack channel, in order to communicate
 homework/assignments, and to faciliate class discussion.
 I need feedback to ensure that everyone will be aware of assignments,
 whether they miss class on a day or not.
- Announce the first homework.
- Ask about Python.  Did people have trouble reading the code?  What
 would you like more explanation on?  I need feedback, as I do not
 know people's programming backgrounds.  Please don't be shy.  I do
 not know what you do not know, and to help you, I need to know.
- Demonstrate Method Chaining.
- Ask about speed at which I covered the demos.
- Show the fun demos. Minecraft in Python.  Craft in C. glPortal. opengldemos (Water demo is 15).
- Show the MVP demo and animated demo to show why we are learning what we are learning
- cover blocking vs non-blocking io. Describe how you are using tail.
- Re go over from demo 05 on.  I went a little to fast last time.  Rego over
 the stencil buffer, as I did not spend enough time on it.
- Cover up to camera space.  I doubt we will, but if we get to camera space,
  go over the currency diagrams, and talk about inversions.  If the students
  can understand this univariate example, they will have a solid foundation
  to take on everything in the ModelViewProject Tree.
  I will need to write up more in the comments for this demo though.
