Agenda 10 FEB 2020

- Announce homework due 17 FEB, homework/due17FEB2020.txt
- Regover highlights from demo 14.
  - re show mvpVisualization/demoViewWorldTopLevel.py
- go over 15 again, emphasize what enabled the depth test
- cover demo 16, the perspective projection.  This is
  what makes computer graphics look realistic, instead
  of like a blueprint diagram
  - show mvpVisualization/demoPerspective.py
- go over demo 17, making a stack of transformations using lambdas
  to avoid repetitive code.  For the purposes of understanding,
  don't worry if you don't fully understand the lambda parts.
  This section is just meant to be a bridge between the math
  that we've been doing so far, to the model view and projection
  matricies.
- go over demo 18, which is the standard way OpenGL programs
  were actually written, before OpenGL 3.3 core profile.
  Discuss push matrix, pop matrix, but don't go into the math
  just yet

- go over demo 14 - as far as I can go.

- cover blocking vs non-blocking io. Describe how you are using tail.



Material to be covered at unknown date that may not be covered in the book:
Subset of linear algebra
  - matrix multiplication
  - inverses
  - dot product
  - cross product
  - right hand rule
  - viewing matrix multiplication front to back vs back to front
  - tree of transformations from a top level space
  - perhaps RREF
  - perhaps A=CDR to demonstrate row space vs column space,
    as well as being useful towards projecting geometry for
    the shadow section of the OpenGL Superbible v4, old testament.
Debugging
  - gdb for C code (build Craft in debug mode using CMake)
  - pdb for python
  - how to use
     - set breakpoints
     - step line
     - step in
     - step out
