Read Chapter 5 of the OpenGL Superbible v4.  (you should figure out how
to run the demo code too, and study the source, although that's
not graded for this chapter.  Email me if you need help or have questions
about it)

The answers are mainly directly from the book.  Read all of Chapter 5
of the book.  You can literally read the first question, read the book
until you find it, write in your answer, read the next question, read
the book until you find it.

1) (5 points) What is simply a wavelength of light that is visible
to the human eye?

2) (5 points) The light that you see is a ______ of many different kinds
of light, identified by their wavelengths

3) (5 points) What is the visible spectrum?

4) (5 points) What is black?  What is white?

5) (5 points) Some photons are reflected and some photons are _______.

6) (5 points) What makes light bright?

Skip reading PC Color Hardware, the section is antiquated.
Return reading on 180, Going Deeper

7) (5 points) True or False.  The alpha channel, making a color go from 24 bits to
32 bits, slows down the performance of the computer.

8) (5 points) What floating point number is used to represent no intensity?

9) (5 points) What floating point number is used to represent full intensity?

10) (5 points) What type of shading causes the colors along the line to
vary as they do htrough the color cube, from one color point to the other?


11) (5 points) To enable the answer to 10, what flag does the opengl programmer
need to send to glShadeModel?

12) (5 points)  What are the three major kinds of light used in OpenGL?
[
13) (5 points)   ________ light doesn't come from any particular direction

14) (5 points)  _______  light has a directional component that appears
to come  from a particular direction and is reflected off a surface with
an intensity proportional to the angle at which the light rays strike
the surface.

15) (5 points)   ______ light is a highly directional property,
but it interacts more sharply with the surface and in a particular
direction.

16) (5 points) Generally, most scenes in the real world are illuminated
by a _____ light containing an even mixture of all the colors.

17) (5 points) When using lighting, we don't describe polygons as having a color,
but rather consisting of _______________.

18) (5 points)  Thus, the ____________________ components actually determine
the percentage of incident light that is reflected.

19) (5 points) What is the main call needed to enable lighting/materials?

20) (5 points) this ____________________ is a zero cost way to add a simple
offset to the results of OpenGL lighting calculations.

21) (5 points) What is color tracking?

22) (5 points)  How many independent light sources are available in OpenGL 2?

23)(5 points)  A normal vector is a line pointed in a direction that is at
a ___ degree angle to the surface of your polygon

24) (5 points) What is a unit normal?

25) (5 points) What is normalization?

26) (5 points) If you take the cross product of two vectors, the resulting
vector is ____________ to that plane.

27) (5 points) If the last value (the w component) of the light position
is 0.0, what does that indicate about the light?

28) (5 points) What line from the spot code listing is actually what makes
a positional light source into a spotlight?
